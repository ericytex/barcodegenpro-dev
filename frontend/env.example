# You MUST set these environment variables in Vercel Dashboard:
# 1. Go to Vercel Dashboard > Your Project > Settings > Environment Variables
# 2. Add these variables for Production environment:
#    - VITE_API_BASE_URL = https://194.163.134.129:8034/
#    - VITE_API_KEY = frontend-api-key-12345
#    - VITE_ENVIRONMENT = production
#    - VITE_DEBUG = false
#    - VITE_LOG_REQUESTS = false
#    - VITE_ENABLE_DEV_TOOLS = false
#    - VITE_SHOW_API_LOGS = false
# 3. Redeploy your project after adding the variables
#
# If you don't set these, the app will use fallback values but may not work correctly.
