# 🚀 Deployment Options - Which One Should You Use?

## ✅ What We Set Up

1. **Automated Deployment Script** - `./start-local.sh`
2. **Docker Compose** - `docker-compose up -d`
3. **Quick Start Guide** - `QUICK_START.md`
4. **Detailed Guide** - `LOCAL_DEPLOYMENT.md`

---

## 🎯 **Option 1: One-Command Deployment** ⭐ EASIEST

```bash
./start-local.sh
```

**What it does:**
- Checks all prerequisites
- Lets you choose Docker or Local
- Sets up everything automatically
- Starts your services

**Best for:** First time deployment, want it to "just work"

---

## 🎯 **Option 2: Docker Compose** ⭐ FASTEST

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

**What it does:**
- Builds Docker images
- Starts both backend and frontend
- Access at http://localhost:80

**Best for:** Quick test, production-like environment

**Access:**
- Frontend: http://localhost:80
- Backend: http://localhost:8034
- API Docs: http://localhost:8034/docs

---

## 🎯 **Option 3: Local Development** 🔧

**Terminal 1 (Backend):**
```bash
cd backend
source venv/bin/activate
python app.py
```

**Terminal 2 (Frontend):**
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

**Best for:** Active development, debugging, hot-reload

## 📍 Recommended: Start Here

### Step 1: Deploy
```bash

## 🛠️ Useful Commands

```bash
# View running containers
docker-compose ps

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f

# Stop services
docker-compose down

# Restart after code changes
docker-compose restart

# Rebuild images
docker-compose up -d --build

# Check logs for a specific service
docker-compose logs -f backend
docker-compose logs -f frontend
```

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Issue:** Port 80 already in use
```bash
# Find what's using port 80
sudo lsof -i :80

# Or change the port in docker-compose.yml
# Edit line 51 to use a different port
```

**Issue:** Database errors
```bash
# Reset the database
rm backend/data/barcode_generator.db*
docker-compose restart backend
```

**Issue:** Container won't start
```bash
# Check logs
docker-compose logs backend
docker-compose logs frontend

# Rebuild from scratch
docker-compose down
docker-compose build --no-cache
docker-compose up -d
```
